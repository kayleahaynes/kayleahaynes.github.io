### Introduction 
Data: [TidyTuesday 14th May 2024](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-05-14)

> <b> The Great American Coffee Taste Test </b>
> 
> In October 2023, "world champion barista" James Hoffmann and coffee company Cometeer held the > "Great American Coffee Taste Test" on YouTube, during which viewers were asked to fill out a > survey about 4 coffees they ordered from Cometeer for the tasting. Data blogger Robert McKeon > Aloe analyzed the data the following month.

To kick start my creative flow I decided to take a quick look at some TidyTuesday data. Instead of getting bogged down in the details, I did some quick exploratory data analysis (EDA) and found something that could be interesting to plot. 

I choose to explore `favorite` by `age`. 

I turned to my go-to visualization: the stacked bar chart. I plotted the breakdown of favorite coffee choices across different age categories. Here are a few customisations I made to enhance the chart: 

<b>Flipped the y-axis</b>: I always find categories easier to read when they're along the y-axis.

<b>Ordered by total count</b>: Instead of sticking with the natural age order, I arranged the bars by total count. While you could argue for the natural order, bar ordering often feels arbitrary (usually alphabetical), so I prefer the longest bars at the top.

<b>Color scheme</b>: I chose shades of brown and black to tie in with the coffee theme.

It wasn't until I had finished this I went back and looked at the [blog post](https://rmckeon.medium.com/great-american-coffee-taste-test-breakdown-7f3fdcc3c41d) linked to TidyTuesday, there are so may bar charts there! 

### Review and Suggestions for Future Enhancements

#### Review:
While I often rely on stacked bar charts for my day-to-day visualizations, I typically use them with just two categories. In this example, where I’ve plotted multiple categories, it is quite challenging to compare the count of favorites across different age groups.

#### Suggestions for Future Enhancements:
<b>Faceted Bar Charts</b>: To make the data easier to understand, I could split it into separate bar charts using facets. This way, each age category gets its own chart, making it simpler to compare the favorite counts without the visual clutter of a stacked bar chart.

<b>Proportional Representation</b>: Another idea is to convert the absolute counts to proportions. This approach would highlight the relative preferences within each age category, giving a clearer picture of the data. Proportional bar charts can make patterns more obvious than when using absolute values.
