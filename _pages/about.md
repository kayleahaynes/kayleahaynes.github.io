Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kaylea, a lead commercial data scientist in the field of cyber security.

I love simplicity and firmly believe in finding the simplest solutions to solve problems. I'm passionate about taking complex ideas and communicating them in an easy-to-understand way.

Occasionally, I enjoy dabbling in data visualisation. While I don't get as much time as I once did for regular visualisation challenges (you can check out my GitHub for past projects), I hope this website helps me rediscover my creative flow.

In keeping with the theme of simplicity, I have a special fondness for bar charts. This website pays homage to the trusty bar chart, using them as a foundation to explore and experiment with different data visualisation techniques.
